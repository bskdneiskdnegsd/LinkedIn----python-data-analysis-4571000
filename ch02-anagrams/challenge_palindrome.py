Palindromes are pairs of words that become each other when we reverse the order of their letters. That means that all palindromes are anagrams!

Your task: Write a function that returns all palindromes of seven letters or more. You will work with the dictionary of anagram sets indexed by signature that we created in video 02_03.

Parameters
